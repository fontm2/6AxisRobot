# 6AxisRobot
An introduction course in programming during my bachelor studies in mechanical engineering awoke my interest in programming. After the basics i continued learning online and with books.
This was my first project in which I made my first serious tries in C#. I was a machnaical engineering student, so i wanted to controll some hardware.
