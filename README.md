# 6AxisRobot
This was my first project in which I made my first serious tries in C#. I was a machnaical engineering student, so i wanted to controll some hardware. 

Use without the Hardware:

Select "Simulation" under the node "Mode"
Open the the "SpiralMisch_neu.txt" under "Datei Ã¶ffnen"
Click "Start NC Calculation"
Click "Start G-Code"
